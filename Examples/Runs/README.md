Here we provide example runs that we have implemented for two different projects:

# Zebrafish

Small project that were ran using SRA accession codes as input. These accession codes are inputed inside `NCBI_accession_list.txt` file.

# COSMIC

Large cancer cell-lines project, where we used a local copy of the input fastq.gz files as an input. The paths and the name of the samples needs to be provided inside a `desing.tvs` file.
